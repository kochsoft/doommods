# What is this?

An almost trivial Doom mod I have written for two reasons:

* I always wanted a ready-to-use light amp available. Guess I am pampered by Doom 3's duct-tape mode.
* I also always wanted to once-in-my-life write a Doom Mod. Since I have little spare time and less artistic skill the K.I.S.S. principle guided the project.

# How to use this?

## Installation

It is a simple wad to be added to your (g)zdoom call. As a Linuxer say something like
`
./gzdoom lightamp.zip
`

On windows I hear that it suffices to drop the file on the doom executable. However, never witnessed that drag-n-drop magic myself.

## Usage in game

Under Customize Controls you will find the menu "MHK Helper Bag". Open it and assign keys to the night amp and the berserk toggle keys.

Later, while playing, you can use these keys to trigger berserk and/or night vision mode.

# Sounds

I wanted _some_ sound. So I played a high D and a lower E powerchord on my old acoustic guitar and used these for on and off.
Lame as hell, I know. But free of charge! Feel free to replace by something of your own if you see any potential in further developing this most glorious mod!

# Special Thanks

Special thanks go to "Brohnesorge". He wrote the quite fulminant "Hearts of Demons - Baron" mod, which not only I enjoyed to play (and
recommend for anyone who loves an artistically well-done cross between "Russian Overkill" and "Diablo 2" Sorceress Magic, but which
also gave a template for this almost trivial mod you see here. Actually the light amp is little more than a rip-off of Bohnesorge's
"Baron Vision" code.

Also many thanks to the authors of ZDoom.org's excellent Wiki pages.
